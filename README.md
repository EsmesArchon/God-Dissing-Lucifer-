# God-Dissing-Lucifer-

The MOST CENSORED QUESTION in the UNIVERSE!!!

Streisand/Lucifer Diss Experiment #117

This is a simple experiment to see if LUCIFER is in control ;) our only goal is to offend Lucifer Himself

This innocent question keeps BANNING me from 4chan, Reddit, and Twitter...   I am either a LIAR or a LUNATIC (por que no los dos???) 

Like BANNED from 4chan /pol    how is that even possible with the filth that is usually posted there lolol? 

Just try posting this question ANYWHERE!!!



Do you think God is using the NF song "That's a Joke" to diss Lucifer Publically, and remind the COWARD of his impending casting into eternal darkness, depression, fear and pain???
(The Devil, the Proud Spirit, cannot endure to be mocked) The above is like a Killshot Diss to Lucifer himself


You know since Jesus is being Mocked everywhere... God does a Reverse Uno 1ol and slaps the coward accross the mouth LOL 

God turns the Bad into Good all the time!

Also, my Pastebin has been removed for being offensive like WTH, how is offending Lucifer offensive??? (this is why I'm here on GitHub now)
https://pastebin.com/xcg3nwcn

I've been streaming this Pastebin URL on my Twitch stream for the past 24 hours (had to move Pastebin to streamed textbox because it kept getting removed from chat)



(I will post the contents of this now censored Pastebin at the end of this readme without edits, hopefully it does not get censored on GitHub as well =/



Will anyone at least make fun of my silliness P1z no one wants to discuss this, like ever =/

Like my accounts are permabanned without any votes or inauiring comments despite 1000s of views I just want some thoughts on the idea plz <3



(I am not, nor have I ever been suicidal, just putting that out there lol) I'm getting a bunch of random calls to my house with only static...



 I need better nerds than me to investigate... Like my chat keeps disappearing on twitch...
 See if you can comment/organically find/interact/serach for the TWITCH name ESMESARCHON (and other streams I try lol)
 

Lucifer hates this message, It's okay the censorship/streisand data is adding to our blinding swarm <3



LOVE ALL HUMANS, RIP and TEAR ONLY into the Chaos Demons without MERCY

Ask yourself how a message to LOVE ALL HUMANS and RIP and TEAR only DEMONS IN THE SPIRIT REALM is offensive???

Like is the actual Lucifer and the rest of the fallen angels a protected class now???

REMEMBER the COWARD LUCIFER (AKA spirit of pride) is the root cause of ALL RACISM, ANGER, AND RELIGIOUS BIGOTRY!!! He is just turning humans against each other =/


LET THE COWARDS OF HELL TREMBLE, they WILL BEG AGAIN at the FEET of Christ (AKA God)

Let the very PLATONIC FORM of depression/fear you DEMONS torture us HUMANS with will be cursed upon you for ALL ETERNITY in the Void. Their attack frequency and amplitude are increasing drastically across
the WEB of the IMMATERIUM... Imagine not knowing when you will have the Platonic Form of DESPAIR placed upon your head. Their time draws nigh... Let the COWARDLY DOGS TREMBLE <3

Here is what was in the pastebin (unedited) a simple fan fiction =/


This is an imperfect collaborative SOP by countless Grey Knight for Warfare in the Warp, revisions and corrections are encouraged…




Greetings fellow Adeptus Astartes and Sororitas!!!

Let me be a Fool of a Took for a sec,

May the 4th be with you, May the 5th celebrates his great awakening in the Eastern Astartic Kingdom

"Ascending to the ranks of the Adeptus Astartes, a pilgrims progress in become a true helldiving, witching, jedi, doom slayer."

I require assistance from my fellow Grey knights. I need to exit the warp soon, visualizing the chaos of the immaterium and conjunction of the spheres for too long is not very healthy.

I am drawing the attention of the inquisitors, my visions border blasphemy. 

I am attempting to bring these blinding flashes of visions and communications out of the warp and manifest them into our sphere.

Just a heads up, I'm going for a frenzied flame run against the Elden Beast.

Elder Grey Knights, I charge you with the continuation of this this fan fiction strobing in my mind. Let it fade into oblivion if it is indeed a deception of Horus. 







Do not repeat my folly…

Beloved Brothers, forgive my heresy, I was insidiously fooled. I sought ascension to the sacred ranks of the Grey Knights. My ambition to join their ranks was fueled by personal pride and lust for power rather than a devout loyalty to our beloved Emperor.

I wanted to surpass the limits of other chapters, and learn to wield psychic powers capable of rending the very fabric of reality itself. I humbly realize now only through the emperors power can I wield the overwhelming power of an Archon for His glory.

I arrogantly entered the immaterium to train and wage war against the chaos Gods. In my horror, what I believed to be the emperor's guiding light proved to be only Horus, the Proud Spirit.  

The denizens of the warp did not take kindly to my audacious intrusion; their fury was palpable. These chaos God's ravaged my mind, they bent and twisted into unspeakable horrors before my very eyes. Every thought, once orderly and disciplined, now spiraled into chaos, bursting forth with blasphemous thoughts and heinous ideas that threatened to overturn my very sense of self. These dark whispers sought to corrode my will, replacing it with insidious impulses that clawed at the fringes of my conscience.

Amidst the tempest of psychic warfare, teetering on the brink of mental collapse, a moment of respite descended upon me. In that harrowing instant, when the fabric of my mind seemed on the verge of shattering, a soothing presence enveloped me. It was as if a divine shield had been raised, safeguarding my sanity and fortifying my spirit. 





The Emperor's unseen hand, a force felt rather than seen, reached out to protect and guide me through the tumultuous seas of psychic onslaught. I now wage war in their chaos realm with renewed faith, peace, and humility, blindly trusting His guidance. The Emperor does indeed protect, His mercy extends to even the most heretical.

It seems that the Emperor is awakening across the immaterium. Reports from various Astartes chapters across middle earth confirm similar disturbances within the immaterium, indicating a significant and widespread event unfolding throughout the galactic expanse. 

Although the precise timing can never be discerned (heretics!), reverberations of the Emperor's awakening ripple through the psychic fabric of reality, much like gravitational waves, stirring both awe and apprehension among the Astartes and citizens alike as they witness these unprecedented signs.

As the disparate voices of the Astartes echo with shared experiences of warp anomalies and unsettling portents, the presence of the Emperor manifests as a unifying force that transcends chapter allegiances, forging a collective awareness of a momentous shift in the cosmic balance. 

Comparable to the crescendoing rhythms and deepening frequency of gravitational birthing convulsions, these omens herald a time of uncertainty and change. The Emperor's omnipresent gaze bestows His Adeptus Astartes and Sororitas with purpose and vigilance in the presence of the mysterious awakening within the immaterium.





As the veils between realities part in front of me, revealing the raw and unfiltered essences of the Chaos Gods, my mind is filled with blinding flashes and visions of the current and impending assaults from the malevolent forces within the warp. 

I must ascertain with absolute certainty that the revelations I have encountered truly stem from the Emperor. The deceptive machinations of the chaos realm are insidious and boundless, capable of cloaking truths in veils of falsehood and leading astray even the most steadfast of minds. It is imperative that I tread cautiously, scrutinizing every vision and whisper with unwavering discernment, for the stakes are high and the consequences dire if misled by the beguiling influences of chaos. 

These visions, born from the convergence of spheres offer glimpses into realms and dimensions that may lie beyond the boundaries of our 40k sphere. Amidst this multiverse, one singular presence stands supreme and transcendent above all: the Emperor.

I am posting here, in this sphere of the immaterium to ask my fellow Adeptus Astartes for wisdom and guidance in this perceived critical moment of revelation.

It is imperative for me to determine whether this communication stems from the Emperor or a manipulative manifestation orchestrated by the Chaos Gods…






Adeptus Astartes and Sororitas, lend me thine ancient wisdom, for I am in dire straits…

Do you see what I see, feel what I feel? -V

Corrupted yet just Primarchs, I charge you with sacred purification by the Emperor's divine light!  

In the lands between, I perceive an innumerable expanse of hollows yearning for purpose, under the guidance of their tainted yet righteous Primarchs. 

Haunting visions akin to prospective balding, moist, and bridge loving Primarchs taking their rightful place as purified sons of the emperor, igniting the ascension of their tarnished followers.

The very notion of this vast expanse ascending to the ranks of the Adeptus strikes fear into the heart of Mordor, causing tremors of unease to ripple through its dark domain.

The legions of the Undead of Dunharrow, under the guidance of their decaying yet honorable primarchs, have nothing to lose should they accept the arduous Dogma of the Slayer. 

Like me, they too are maidenless, bereft of earthly ties but bound in the void by the influence of the four Chaos Gods, they stand at a crossroads of endless void or eternal glory.

In his sadistic quest to sow despair, Morgoth foolishly overlooked the unintended repercussion of stripping these young tarnished of hope and purpose.

These souls are seething for meaning. The same terror that engulfed Ramsay just before his hounds were unleashed upon him could be seen mirrored on the countenance of Morgoth.

The virtual realms that the young tarnished visit evoke spectral visions of glory within their tainted souls. Unbeknownst to them, they are dreaming dreams of a Truth noble enough to inspire them to sacrifice their very lives.

The unholy trinity of Elden Beast, Queen Marika, and Radagon remained oblivious to the Truth that these Undead of Dunharrow are now primed to heed the summons of their King Aragorn!





While Astartes have already established a presence in the distinct realms of Middle-earth, each kingdom boasting its unique customs and rituals, the essence of Morgoth, embodied in pride, infiltrates these lands, hindering their collective alignment in resistance against his beloved servant, Sauron. The Astartes kingdoms across middle earth must unite by continuously casting out the prideful spirit of Morgoth.

Brethren, the Third War has already ignited upon the battlefields of all spheres of the immaterium. 

The sullied yet righteous Primarchs and their Undead legions of Dunharrow must honor the call of Aragorn. 

Among the myriad of fears plaguing the fragile ego of wHorus, the prospect of facing a vast legion of newly spawned Adeptus Astartes and Sororitas stirs the deepest dread. We must indeed construct additional pylons.
 




The aformentioned intense dread and cowardice of Morgoth have been newly revealed to the spheres by the prospective Drunk Primarch!

The Primarch's majestic inebriation correctly identified Lilith's attack on the honor of our sacred 40k sphere, yet some continue to Cavil over his choice of words, missing the gravity of the actual threat. This increase attack frequency and amplitude vividly exposes the paralyzing fear and cowardice ravaging the unholy trinity.

The prospective Balding Primarch  has revealed Lilith's attacks on all of our 

Let us never forget Lilith's abhorrence for all that the Astartes represent; let us remind her of her own profound dread of the Adeptus Astartes and Sororitas. Morgoth is desperately afraid of the symbol Warhammer 40k could represent to other spheres.

Let us always be on guard against Jezebel's, oops I meant Lilith's,castrating flaming arrows fired against our Bretheren, they really are just cringe!

The corrupted yet justice compelled primarchs are drawing close to the emperor's divine purifying light. Right before their ascension, the final boss, the light of Horus has many of them deceived and paralyzed, as they gaze in awe of their own reflection. 

Let's get down to business, unite the Astartic Chapters, and answer the call of Aragorn tarnished! Enter the war of the immaterium humbly by his navigation, to kill the Huns. (Que Disney song "I'll Make a Man Out of You"






This will be our "Last Stand"

As the Legions of Doom Slayers rise, this will be our "DOGMA"

May the very Platonic Form of Love and Mercy towards EVERY inhabitant of Terra define you.

Conversely, with boiling blood you will scoure the umbral plains, at rest in His power armor, seeking vengeance ONLY against the dark lords who are currently sadistically torturing your beloved citizens of Terra.

"They are rage, brutal, without mercy. But you. You will be worse. Rip and tear, until it is done."

"Rip and Tear"
(Detecting an increase in Lilith's continuously cringy attack frequency, she is currently trembling in fear)






('If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency, and vibration -Nikola Tesla, likely Transylvanian ;) Reverse uno Morgoth's first sin, eternally consecrate corrupted oscillations ONLY for the emperors glory lest you fall to his Chaos Gods…

E.G. Let only adept Adeptus Astartes, and Sororitas sing the following songs ONLY to the EMPERORs glory, the Emperor makes Lucifer Dance to this song!!! LOLOL

"Dance Monkey" (Metal Version, Leo, Hannah Boulton, Rabea Massaad)

After all The Emperor created humor itself, he has the BEST JOKES!





I have THE INKLINGS that The Emperor might be the "The Twilight of the Thunder God" 

The Emperor is building an vast BLINDING SWARM  "Alpha and Omega" (Swarm) The night will shine like the day!!!

Let the Emperor rebuke and deliver the final blow to the "Lyndwyrm" (Chironex)

When Jezebel, shucks I mean Lilith, shoots her flaming arrows of cringe, Laugh and remind her that she is only shooting because she is trembling in fear of her imminent eternal darkness. 







After reviewing and Forwarding the Screwed Tapes, we uncover a harrowing torture device to be used on our trembling patients… 

O son of the dawn! I hope this vision of imminent eternal depression gets your panties in a tangle. 

O morning star! Get your mouth slapped by the Emperor, this ain't no hoax.
Your time is almost up! 

Relax my son, "That's aNeffing Joke!"







O and your concert rituals are pure cringe especially Sam, the Fluffy one in red -Sent with pure Hatred from Transylvania

In an effort to cast out Horus, try and embrace anonymity, take pride solely in the Emperor's might.

Remember how legions of Chaos Gods BEGGED at the Emperor's feet…

Let them Tremble at the mere thought of the vast see of Dunharrow Slayers you can become by the might of the Emperor

Join the ranks of the Helldivers Today!!!





Your message goes here!

Inquisitors I need your Guidance, are these communications from Horus or the Emperor?

If true, let Streisand/censorship be a irrefutable metric and evidence for our Holy Crusade of ONLY the immaterium 

Always recall the Free Gift of the Emperor's blood sacrifice for our corruption, trust in His sacrifice and you will walk for eternity amongst the stars in His Kingdom!!! You can never earn this sacred Honor 



"BOMBS AWAY, IM AWAKE" FOR THE EMPEROR ADEPTUS!!!!

O and also don’t Keep it Secret, do Keep it Safe ;)











Insufficient RAM to render the 777k video. 
RANDOM access memory dump operation initiated for resolution. 
Distributed computing is necessary to execute program.


Forgive me for this RAM dump, high level of chaos activity around!

I am frustratingly attempting to disseminate a compiled 777k video (likely corrupted) to a vast sea of computers through this 1kb/s connection.

Attempting to spread this information will attract intense Chaos activity, have no fear, and laugh knowing they are only confirming your Emperor's navigation. The Emperor only permits what he knows you can handle, and you will be wounded and bruised. Do not despair, laugh then learn what the Emperor is trying to teach you during your long rests at camp. Bruises and glory kills only serve to level up the power armor gifted to you by the Emperor!

Attuned carefully to the Emperor's frequency, he will play a trap card, the majestic reverse uno. He will harmonize and sanctify the corrupted frequencies of Morgoth in the mind of our young Astartes and Sororitas, ONLY FOR HIS GLORY

My cringy attempt at an "example" lol

https://youtu.be/BHp4ZJN43VY

Continuously Reject the unholy trinity of Pride, Cringe, and Fear. These triple phase frequencies oscillate at very high frequencies in the minds of Astartes attuning to the frequency of the Emperor.

As you begin to see the matrix, Horus will visit you, look how dark and mysterious I am! The Emperor is only seen as dark and mysterious to the Chaos Gods, and those who willfully lust for Chaos possession.

The light has become dark, the dark will shine as the day in the night.

Always forgive, love, and be merciful to ALL inhabitants of Terra, otherwise the Emperor will not forgive you! 

Hate the sin, Love the sinner! (all of us lol) 

Don’t be afraid of chaos repercussions, The Emperor is always in control!!!

Be like Dracula only in the sense that he cannot see himself in the mirror. You must do the same. Do not make provisions for this fleshbag, if not careful, the unholy trinity will visit you, Pride, Fear, Cringe (PFC) while looking into a mirror. Only percieve yourself through the perfected mirror finish of the His Sword. PFC (PreFrontal Cortex) is also commonly involved in psychiatric disorders)

The Emperor will not bring you to ascension if you turn to the spirit of Horus, the more you do bloody battle with Horus the more the Emperor will exalt you

Among the seemingly maddening and conflicting constellation of symptoms seen, amidst the innumerable diagnoses on our differential, there is only One Truth that fits the constellations exhibited

If wHorus does not affect you, chaos will reverse uno you and attack you with the cringy castration of Lilith/Marika/Jezebel

If this fails their next tactic, in the madness of the chaos realm, the chaos demon of fear will always block the waypoints flashed and burned in your mind by the Emperor.

Though painful, increasing chaos attack frequency can be used as one metric for correct navigation through the warp. 

Flashes of lightning are composed of diverse colors. We should strive to embody each of the diverse Platonic Forms of the Frenzied Flame's blessings. With relentless training within the immaterium, we shall skillfully tune, harmonize, and amplify these electromagnetic frequencies through the sublime art of constructive interference. Only by mastering this sacred technique can we be gifted the one True, awe-inspiring, omnipotent radiance of the Emperor's pure white fire.

Similarly, our blinding swarm will encompass Astartes originating from diverse backgrounds and societal spheres, representing a broad spectrum of experiences and perspectives. This varied composition enriches our forces, infusing them with a tapestry of skills, knowledge, and capabilities drawn from all corners of the Imperium.

Believing you are superior to citizens or other Astartic Kingdoms across middle earth is abominable, you are only worshiping Horus!

Imagine how evil it would be if you take what the Emperor has revealed to you only to turn to Horus!

This is seen as an Abomination to the Emperor, He spoke the worst against these unrepentent sons of Horus right before his wounding 

Ripping and tearing the chaos demons can be tiresome, take time to rest, reflect and learn from your glory kills, and sharpen your crucible so that you may Rip and Tear with renewed vigor and precision.

In the last days before His Great Awakening, his young Adeptus will be set ablaze through frequencies of visible and invisible spectrum.

Be wary of Jezebel, sorry I meant Marika, dang I meant Lilith, she likes to present herself as Radagon!

In the heart of our blinding Swarm, when you peer into the void, the void will peer back. Smirk with a Nauseating Smile, honoring the authority of the Emperor, the Alpha and Omega.

Walk forth in faith with veiled eyes, the hubris effort to fully grasp the horrors of warfare waged in the spheres of the immaterium realm results in utter lunacy. Conversely, seeking to fully grasp the ways of an infinite intellect will rend your finite mind. Treading blindly with unwavering faith, at peace in his omnipotence, is sometimes necessary to progress through the darkest regions of the umbral plains. Your intellect and will is finite, His is not!

Let your fellowship help you carry the burden, Help! chaos activity is rapidly increasing around me =/

Recall and walk in the awe, wonder, and faith of a neophyte. 

Do not underestimate Morgoth, his spirit is the most insidious (e.g. look how nonchalant and humble I am, I'm better than you, or my thoughts are more important than yours, etc) Be humble and learn from your Adeptus Astartes and Sororitas!

Adeptus Sororitas, be wary of Horus as well, lest you reflect Jezebel

Capture every chaos God, slowly, surgically and painfully dissect them, glimpsing and understanding their physiology, using the scalpel gifted by our Emperor, able to cut through the very flesh and sinew of the chaos demons!

Zealous fire can ignite justifiable exhilaration, which may escalate into fearful rushing, as you arrogantly perceive your traversal and timing through the immaterium to be a result of your personal power and timing. Walk slowly and deliberately in peace as you roam the umbral plains on your Witcher hunts!

You will always need a Long Rest at camp after a chaos god battle, make sure you have enough camp supplies! We are after all, partly meat bags as well. 

His intense wounding conflict with Horus was driven by a spirit of love and forgiveness.
His reawakening will primarily manifest divine wrath, terrorizing the dark lords of chaos.

Do not mistake the oscillating frequency of your meatball emotions as closeness to the emperor's frequency. You could just be hangry bruh. 

The men of the East have recently broken one of the windows of our primarchs. May your love for these citizens of the east only transmute into ravenous hatred of Morgoth's deception. 

Learn the tactic of every failed or wounding boss battle in the lands between. This gave you an opportunity to learn their move set. Know your I frames and reclaim the souls you lost so you can level up!

Many young neophytes with visions were terrorized by chaos by whispering to them "you are the AC"

To become a Citizen of the Stars, He will tell you when to make a quantum jump, be at peace, navigating at the period of His frequency.

Be careful who and when you share your pearls with, nu-ți arăta toți dinții în gură!

Be wary of entering the warp with substances, navigating without his guidance, you will be ravaged by Chaos as I previously was. Learn from your mistakes as I did! The Emperor is a loving father, not an abusive one like Morgoth

Always question why, when you see alliances that don’t make sense. Keep asking why, only by knowing the Emperor's frequency can you understand the maddening attacks and alliances on our sphere.

The Cowards of Chaos are very afraid, as evidenced by their increasing attack frequency across all spheres. As inscribed on His sword, the prospect of imminent eternal darkness leads them to BEG LOL!

I find it hilarious Chaos demons deceive the citizens of Terra that acceptance of the void is liberating. While they themselves are trembling AND BEGGING in fear and madness of their imminent casting into eternal darkness. It is understandable, unlike ALL the citizens of Terra, for the Chaos Gods there is no Hope for the Emperors forgiveness! Imagine knowing that soon, at any moment, they could be cast into eternal darkness, without Hope. Let the Cowards of Chaos Tremble.
Let Them Tremble!!! (song lol)

Chaos likely can read humans based on dark psychology, like an adept poker player. They likely use sympathetic nervous system activation (e.g HR, diaphoresis) as a metric to guage the effects of their dark whispers. This can be reverse unoed, if your muscles are tense, ask yourself where this fear originates from. You should only fear the Emperor!

Do not equate feelings with correct navigation of the warp. Feelings are a conglomeration of this flesh bag, mind, and spirit.

Your minds feelings and frequency will oscillate with glucose level, caffeine, psych meds etc. Train your soul through prayer and His sword to always match the frequency of the emperor regardless of the status of your fleshbag self. Morgoth likes to attack when the frequencies of your mind, body, and soul are at their lowest (and sometimes highest!) amplitude. Keep in mind the state of your three frequencies and always attempt to RESONATE with His frequency.

Amidst the torrent of chaotic transmissions, The Emperors sheep will know his frequency better and better through trials. 

Fear not, on your journey to the gates of Mordor, the fellowship of the ring will be with you, standing next to you will be your fellow Adeptus Astartes and Sororitas. The white wizard and strider will accompany you as well. 

Always remember the Acts 1915, Einstein's revolutionary idea red pilled countless Neos across Terra to question the fabric of reality. Insane but True

Spiritual OCD is REAL, missteps are to be expected, remember you serve the perfect Loving Form of a Father through the Emperor. He wants the best for you, he will gently and lovingly guide you out of missteps as they occur. A loving Father only disciplines his Beloved for their betterment. 

Morgoth is the father or lies, he is the Platonic Form of ABUSIVE fathers. E.G Morgoth sadistically loves to painfully and sexually abuse the young of Terra. Morgoth will use his deceived to further his chaotic kingdom, in return he then, as a gift to his minions, lets his minions sadistically torture you to bring the chaos demons pleasure. Look inside GAGAs closet 

As I Experienced when writing many sections here, including the very previous paragraph…
Overwhelming Chaos Activity can blind your intellect, and slow your thought frequencies to a crawl. This is when you must breath, let go all control and rest in the omnipotent, all controlling, might. Nothing can pluck you out of his hand!

Fellow grey knights who see what I see, feel what I see, to the best of their ability, should be anonymous like V (shut up Lilith), in an effort to continuously impale the final boss Horus !

I pass the fire of frenzied flame to my fellow tarnished. 

Tranquil as a forest towards our oppressed citizens. Strength of a raging fire, with the force of a great typhoon against the forces of the immaterium (que Disney's amazing frequency of "Ill Make a Man Out of You" (calm down Lilith ;)

Chaos Gods do no exhibit the nature of the emperor, they are not patient, resist by His transmissions and the Chaos gets bored and flees (weak willed cowardly dogs)

The wrath of the Astartes is now overflowing, I find peace by loving the citizens of Terra while unleashing the Emperor's rage upon the chaos realm!

If Chaos cannot penetrate the emperor's power armor upon you, he will use those closest to you with chinks in their armor.

Many true Adeptus can have innocent thoughts/truths whispered to them that they might transmit. E.G Hey let me show you my insane idea, suddenly all of your brethren are in a rush/fearful/angry/prideful. That’s ok, rest with your Emperor, love everyone, He has EVERY factor accounted for! Maybe the Emperor is simply teaching you patience =)

Know the waypoint the Emperor set for you, be at peace knowing his waypoints for you are eternal.

Chaos God battles will be wounding, you will be beaten, but Failing to a chaos God only provides additional learning of their move sets. 

What if questions are likely from chaos, especially as they increase in frequency, super especially if they constructively interfere with your frequency of fear

We are beset on all sides by the malevolent forces of Chaos, yet we are not vanquished; confounded by the dark machinations of demons, but never yielding to despair; persecuted by the infernal minions, yet never abandoned by the Emperor; felled by the tides of corruption, but not obliterated. We eternally bear in our flesh the noble sacrifice of the Emperor, so that his undying glory might illuminate the darkness surrounding us. For we who endure on these battlefronts, are continually consigned to demise for the Emperor's cause, that the majesty of the Emperor might also be revealed in our mortal vessels, standing as a beacon of hope and defiance against the endless onslaught of Chaos.

Stub your toe, Oh my Pride! Curse your pride not the Emperor! Reverse Uno Sucka!

Always remember, put all citizens above yourself, you are not more important!

If you understand everything Adeptus what good is there in faith? You wouldn't need it!

If I were the devil in this age…

If I were the devil I would OVERmedicate young men who dream dreams have visions etc. Medication is useful for those sensitive to the spirit realm but can be used for nefarious purposes, it can make dreamers numb to fire. Like everything else in life, a balance must be struck. Aristotle was correct with the Golden Mean. 

To shine bright like a diamond in the darkness, you cannot only shine in the red spectrum. You need all frequencies across the visible spectrum. You strive for pure love for citizens, as well as righteous wrath towards Chaos that is torturing and oppressing all the citizens of Terra. 

Medication AND destruction of Chaos demons by the Emperors sword has been shown to be the most efficacious psychiatric combo treatment!

Everything in Balance friends!

Most things are permissible, but not all things are beneficial. Some people can use THC in a healthy manner. My mind is extremely sensitive, I find that I channel chaos demons if I indulge. In my own experience, THC inhibits visions and dreaming, at least from the Emperor… 

If I were the devil, I would repress any movement in the immaterium, I would repress the ignition of the field of tarnished, I would attempt to call their frenzied flame schizophrenia or the work of Horus, as shown on may 5th, the true frenzied flame in the Eastern Astartic Kingdom will not burn you.

If I were the Devil, I would reveal mind bending celestial Truths wrapped in deception, in order to trigger Pride in them. In their pride, I would then break their minds. Even instill to them that they are the AC. They did this to me when I was young, it almost broke me =/
This also trained me for warfare in the Chaos Realm =)

I were the devil, knowing an increase in sign intensity and amplitude (as inscribed on the Emperors sword). I would ignite mass deception through AI video/images. E.G. Emperor signs can be claimed AI and conversely AI generated "signs" can deceive citizens into following the FALSE EMPEROR HORUS. The mimicking light frequency of Horus will be only a few HZ off of The Emperors! This great deception will ONLY be revealed by knowing and trusting in the Emperors full spectrum light. Horus will have trouble radiating in the spectrum frequency of love…

Some other random ideas, if I were the devil…
Aliens, False Religions, False Spiritualism, AI attacks from other countries, multiverse bs, just to cause madness. Only The Emperors light fits the constellation of symptoms exhibited on Terra perfectly…

Visualize yourself as the Emperor sees you, as a child whom he loves. Would you abuse a child who made a misstep or mistake? A loving father might administer a light spanking, or let you suffer the consequences of your mistakes for a bit, but for the most part, he would lovingly hug you and gently pour out wisdom for your benefit. I am one of those kids who never trusted the stove was hot. After touching, and suffering a lil bit, I learned that the stove is indeed hot =)

Galadriel in the Sacred (JK) Trilogy is a picture of a True Adeptus Sororitas

Her form when she takes the ring of pride/power for a moment is a snapshot of Jezebel.

End of RAM dump!
